                    Benchmarking Metaheuristic-Integrated QAOA Against Quantum Annealing (2024)</div>
                <div class="description"><p>The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is one of the most promising Noisy Intermediate Quantum (NISQ) Algorithms in solving combinatorial optimizations and displays potential over classical heuristic techniques. Unfortunately, QAOA’s performance depends on the choice of parameters and standard optimizers often fail to identify key parameters due to the complexity and mystery of these optimization functions. In this paper, we benchmark QAOA circuits modified with metaheuristic optimizers against classical and quantum heuristics to identify QAOA parameters. The experimental results reveal insights into the strengths and limitations of both Quantum Annealing and metaheuristic-integrated QAOA across different problem domains. The findings suggest that the hybrid approach can leverage classical optimization strategies to enhance the solution quality and convergence speed of QAOA, particularly for problems with rugged landscapes and limited quantum resources. Furthermore, the study provides guidelines for selecting the most appropriate approach based on the specific characteristics of the optimization problem at hand.</p>

                    Differential Evolution Algorithm based Hyper-Parameters Selection of Transformer Neural Network Model for Load Forecasting (2023)</div>
                <div class="description"><p>Accurate load forecasting plays a vital role in numerous sectors, but accurately capturing the complex dynamics of dynamic power systems remains a challenge for traditional statistical models. For these reasons, time-series models (ARIMA) and deep-learning models (ANN, LSTM, GRU, etc.) are commonly deployed and often experience higher success. In this paper, we analyze the efficacy of the recently developed Transformer-based Neural Network model in load forecasting. Transformer models have the potential to improve load forecasting because of their ability to learn long-range dependencies derived from their Attention Mechanism. We apply several metaheuristics namely Differential Evolution to find the optimal hyperparameters of the Transformer-based Neural Network to produce accurate forecasts. Differential Evolution provides scalable, robust, global solutions to non-differentiable, multi-objective, or constrained optimization problems. Our work compares the proposed Transformer-based Neural Network model integrated with different metaheuristic algorithms by their performance in load forecasting based on numerical metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Our findings demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic-enhanced Transformer-based Neural Network models in load forecasting accuracy and provide optimal hyperparameters for each model.</p>

                        Comparative Evaluation of Metaheuristic Algorithms for Hyperparameter Selection in Short-Term Weather Forecasting (2023)</div>
                    <div class="description"><p>Weather forecasting plays a vital role in numerous sectors, but accurately capturing the complex dynamics of weather systems remains a challenge for traditional statistical models. Apart from Auto Regressive time forecasting models like ARIMA, deep learning techniques (Vanilla ANNs, LSTM and GRU networks), have shown promise in improving forecasting accuracy by capturing temporal dependencies. This paper explores the application of metaheuristic algorithms, namely Genetic Algorithm (GA), Differential Evolution (DE), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), to automate the search for optimal hyperparameters in these model architectures. Metaheuristic algorithms excel in global optimization, offering robustness, versatility, and scalability in handling non-linear problems. We present a comparative analysis of different model architectures integrated with metaheuristic optimization, evaluating their performance in weather forecasting based on metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). The results demonstrate the potential of metaheuristic algorithms in enhancing weather forecasting accuracy and helps in determining the optimal set of hyper-parameters for each model. The paper underscores the importance of harnessing advanced optimization techniques to select the most suitable metaheuristic algorithm for the given weather forecasting task.</p>

                        An Adaptive Hybrid Quantum Algorithm for the Metric Traveling Salesman Problem (2023)</div>
                    <div class="description"><p>In this paper, we design, analyze, and evaluate a hybrid quantum algorithm for the metric traveling salesman problem (TSP). TSP is a well-studied NP-complete problem that many algorithmic techniques have been developed for, on both classic computers and quantum computers. The existing literature of algorithms for TSP are neither adaptive to input data nor suitable for processing medium-size data on the modern classic and quantum machines. In this work, we leverage the classic computers’ power (large memory) and the quantum computers’ power (quantum parallelism), based on the input data, to fasten the hybrid algorithm’s overall running time. Our algorithmic ideas include trimming the input data efficiently using a classic algorithm, finding an optimal solution for the post-processed data using a quantum-only algorithm, and constructing an optimal solution for the untrimmed data input efficiently using a classic algorithm. We conduct experiments to compare our hybrid algorithm against the state-of-the-art classic and quantum algorithms on real data sets. The experimental results show that our solution truly outperforms the others and thus confirm our theoretical analysis. This work provides insightful quantitative tools for people and compilers to choose appropriate quantum or classical or hybrid algorithms, especially in the NISQ (noisy intermediate-scale quantum) era, for NP-complete problems such as TSP.</p>

                    <div class="description"><p>Our project investigates the links between diet, health, and economics, focusing on the obesity epidemic in the US. With over 40% of adults affected by obesity, largely due to high consumption of processed foods, this issue not only impacts individual health but also imposes a significant financial burden on the healthcare system. We analyze how processed food consumption relates to obesity and financial markets using statistical tests and quantitative models.

                        A key feature of our study is an innovative pairs selection and trading algorithm, which reveals that stocks of companies producing or using processed foods show strong correlations with healthcare sector stocks. This pattern provides opportunities for financial gains, with our strategy yielding 7 profitable pairs and a Sharpe ratio of 1.58.
                        
                        We propose further refining our approach with SARIMA forecasting models to enhance predictive accuracy and offer actionable insights for stakeholders in the food and healthcare sectors.</p>

Our team has developed a series of robust models to simulate and analyze these processes from a comprehensive perspective. By identifying key factors such as passenger walking speed, sitting and standing speed, luggage amount, and customer satisfaction, we created a model that predicts individual passenger behavior during boarding and disembarking. We evaluated common boarding methods, including Random, By Seat, and By Section, to determine the most time-efficient and feasible procedures. Our simulations incorporated various passenger demographics and aircraft models, including Narrow Body, Flying Wing, and Two-Entrance, Two-Aisle configurations. The results indicate that the By Seat method was the fastest for the Narrow Body aircraft, with an average boarding time of 32.6 minutes. The enclosed paper provides a detailed analysis of the performance of other boarding methods.</p>

We analyze volumetric factors like inflow, outflow, and loss, guiding the creation of an adaptable model. Using a Seasonal Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model on data from 2005-2020, we project future elevations and compare results to a linear regression model. Our enhanced approach integrates climate change impacts for more accurate predictions. We also propose a two-phase water reuse plan and recommend conservation practices, demonstrated through a case study highlighting effectiveness and metrics.</p>

However, they typically stop short of accessing quantum hardware and solve numerical problem instances. This tutorial offers a quick hands-on introduction to solving Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems on currently available quantum computers. We cover both IBM and D-Wave machines: IBM utilizes a gate/circuit architecture, and D-Wave is a quantum annealer. We provide examples of three canonical problems (Number Partitioning, Max-Cut, Minimum Vertex Cover), and two models from practical applications (from cancer genomics and a hedge fund portfolio manager, respectively). An associated GitHub repository provides the codes in five companion notebooks. Catering to undergraduate and graduate students in computationally intensive disciplines, this article also aims to reach working industry professionals seeking to explore the potential of near-term quantum applications.</p>
