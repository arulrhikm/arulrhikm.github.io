                <!-- Finally made my own personal website, after much procrastination. I noticed that most other CS kids have blogs on their sites, so just included one as well, but I
                will probably forget about in a month. Submitted the Shipment Rerouting Paper, and went to IBM Cambridge to provide update for the Learning DGM project. I have to meet with Quantum Technologies Group
                regarding the quantum entanglement detection project. Aside from work, I watched The Boys Season 4 Finale and my mom got mad at me for only taking 700 steps today, and didn't make me dinner [rip :( ]. -->
